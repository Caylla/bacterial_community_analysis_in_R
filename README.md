All the data analyses were performed using the software R 3.4.2 (R Development Core Team 2016). Bacterial counts in the host plant rhizosphere were expressed in CFU per gram of dry soil (CFU g−1) and compared using the non-parametricKruskal-Wallis test. The diversity profile of the communities was analyzed through the Hill Series, using the vegan
package. The community dissimilarity was estimated by cluster analysis using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix with abundance data from the four bacterial communities (+AHg, −AHg, + PHg, and −PHg). The species composition of the communities was visualized in the Venn diagram constructed using the Online Software(http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/). The similarity between the communities’ structure according to their functional traits was analyzed through the Jaccard dissimilarity index. Results from the qualitative functional characterization were expressed as positive (+) and negative (−) when a given functional trait
was present or absent, respectively. Non-metric multidimensional scaling using the Bray-Curtis index was performed withthe metaMDS and Adonis function of vegan package. The
indicator species were verified using the labdsv package.Co-occurrence analysis was performed using the Spearman correlation of the hmisc and corrplot packages. In the plant
growth promotion and bioremediation experiments, the treated samples were compared with the control plants grown on substrates contaminated (C+Hg) or not with mercury (C−Hg),
using analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s test, with the aid of the multcomp package.
